    The Augmented Gaussian Process (AGP) is described in [Ca2021ms]_.
    The basic idea is to select a subset of function evaluations (namely,
    augmenting observations), among those performed so far over all the
    cheap sources, to augment the set of observations from the ground
    truth source. The resulting augmented set of observations is used to
    fit the AGP.
    The set of "augmenting observations" is selected depending on a
    discrepancy measure between GP's predictive mean and GPâ€™s predictive
    uncertainty.
